## Motivation

This project requires us to use Adonis and React to create an e-commerce website. 
The project is an e-commerce webiste on beauty products that consists only green ingredients. The brands available on the website 
are all free from animal-cruelty. These is in hopes to promote the importance of our value and mission on sustainable brands and products. 
It aims to attract customers who share the same value and beliefs furthermore attracting a broader customer base by providing a website that contains all the trustworthy brands who are transparent on one platform for easier purchase when searching for brands that they will be able to trust. 

Site owner’s goal: Attract the target audience to purchase the products in the website. 

External user’s goal: The target audience are seeking for beauty products/brands that are sustainable and share the same ethic values as them.

## Strategy 

The purpose of this website is to create a platform where customers who believe in ethical and green ingredients will be able to search beauty products that share the same values as them. This will allow them to save time on doing tedious research on products that are free from animal cruelty, vegan, gluten-free, etc. The main competitors for this website would be Sephora. However they sell a vast products which may not be brands that are transparent or ethical, therefore Seduire is a niche platform. Aiming to bring a community of people who shares similar beliefs.

Fonts: 

Sans serif are used for the website as it conveys approachability and clean. It is modern and embraces simplicity. 
As the website aim is to provide a platform for users to purchase it conveys convinience, hence this font is suitable for the context as it is more appropriate for on-screen use. It seems casual, informal and friendly in order to appear more relatable for the users. The use of sans serif aids in helping not to intimidate users.
